<em>A desert that floods with life</em>
</p>
<p>
Hidden in Brazil’s northeast, <strong><span class="LM">Lençóis Maranhenses</span> National Park</strong> defies expectation. Vast white sand dunes ripple toward the horizon, yet between them lie crystal-clear freshwater lagoons, formed by seasonal rains and glowing in shades of turquoise and jade. It’s surreal, elemental, and quietly unforgettable.
        </p>
        <h3>Why <span class="LM">Lençóis Maranhenses</span> is unlike anywhere else</h3>
        <p><em>There’s no rush here. The landscape sets the pace.</em></p>
        <p>This is a place that resists easy categories. Not desert, not coast, not rainforest, but something entirely its own. Days here are shaped by light, wind, and water. You walk barefoot across warm sand, then slip into cool lagoons as if nature planned the contrast just for you.</p>
         <div id="see">
      <h3>What you’ll see</h3> 
      <ul>
      <li>Endless sculpted dunes shifting with the wind</li>
      <li>Freshwater lagoons so clear you can see the sand ripple beneath</li>
      <li>Flamingos and migratory birds tracing the horizon</li>
      <li>Golden sunsets that turn the dunes rose-pink</li>

    <h3>Food & Flavour</h3>
<p>
Meals are simple, fresh, and deeply tied to place: grilled fish caught that day, rice and beans done perfectly, tropical fruits you’ll struggle to name but never forget. Dining here feels honest and generous without being showy.

      <h4>When to go!</h4>
<p id="when-to-go">
<strong><em>Best season:</em></strong> June to September, when lagoons are full<br>

<strong><em>Quieter magic:</em></strong> Early June or late September, fewer visitors, same wonder<br>

<strong><em>Dry season: </em></strong>Still beautiful, but with fewer lagoons and more about scale and solitude
